    <h1>Massachusetts Rapid Transit and Environmental Justice</h1>
    <h2>Authored by: Jillian Riseman</h2>

      <!-- First column, the left half -->
      <div class="first-column">
        <p>The two maps to the right show two views of the MBTA rapid transit stations in proximity to state-designated Environmental Justice Block Groups. 
          An Environmental Justice Community is defined by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts if one or more of the following four criteria are true:
          <br>
          <br>
          1. The annual median household income is not more than 65 per cent of the statewide annual median household income
          <br>
          2. Minorities comprise 40 per cent or more of the population
          <br>
          3. 25 per cent or more of households lack English language proficiency
          <br>
          or
          <br>
          4. Minorities comprise 25 per cent or more of the population and the annual median household income of the municipality in which the neighborhood is located does not exceed 150 per cent of the statewide annual median household income.
          <br>
          <br>
          The focus is on the rapid transit trains rather than buses because the bus system provides a significantly less reliable service and is dependent on far more factors (traffic, weather, road construction, etc.) than the trains. If my map is about effective accessibility, expanding train services would have a much greater impact on underserved communities than additional bus stops and routes, (in my opinion).
          <br>
          <br>
          I've symbolized the Environmental Justice Block Groups on a gradient by Median Household Income to think about community needs and what neighborhoods might be in greater need of expanded service. These maps show areas with the lowest income as the darkest, most noticable color, indicating the highest need. The second map shows the same view as the first, with added .5- and 1-mile buffers around each station to show what is considered reasonable distance of able-bodied walkable accessability. Right away, 5 areas stick out as spots with inadequate train access - north between Malden's Orange Line and Revere's Blue Line, northwest beween Malden and Cambridge, west from Watertown to Waltham, south through Dedham as an Orange or Red Line extension, and southeast of Quincy into Weymouth.
          <br>
          <br>
          Though not reflected in this data, earlier this year the MBTA ceebrated the opening of the Green Line Extension. This years-long process was approved in 2017 and will provide service northward from the Lechmere stop in Cambride through that Somerville-Medford gap to the northwest of Boston. <a href="https://www.mbta.com/projects/green-line-extension-glx">View details of the project here.</a> 
          <br>
          <br>
          Taking a close look at that area on my map though, you can see that there are not many block groups in that gap of service that are at the lowest income level, and those that are, are just north of where the extension stops. Looking closer at some of the other gaps in service around the city, we can see several low-income areas in Everett, Malden, and Revere that are just outside of reasonable access to service. Simiarly, there are major service gaps south of Boston between the Orange and Red Lines where there are many neighborhoods in the lowest median income category, that could greatly benefit from increased access to rapid transit.
